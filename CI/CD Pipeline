Start by creating a workflow file in your GitHub repository. This file contains the steps that the CI/CD pipeline will follow.

In the workflow file, define a trigger for the pipeline, such as a push to the main branch or a pull request event.

Next, define the build step, where the code is compiled and tested. This step can be done using a pre-existing GitHub Actions workflow or by defining a new one.

Once the build step is completed, deploy the code to a test environment using another GitHub Actions workflow. This step can involve actions such as provisioning infrastructure, deploying the code, and running tests.

Finally, if the tests pass, the code can be automatically deployed to production.

Here is a sample workflow file using GitHub Actions:

yaml
Copy code
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Build and test code
      run: |
        # Run build and test commands here

  deploy-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to test environment
      run: |
        # Provision infrastructure and deploy code here

  deploy-prod:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: deploy-test
    if: success()
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to production
      run: |
        # Deploy code to production here
        
In this example, the CI/CD pipeline is triggered when a push is made to the main branch. The pipeline performs the following steps: checkout code, build and test, deploy to test environment, and finally deploy to production if all tests pass.
